<p>The colour, the texture, the versatility…</p>
<p>Are you <em>really</em> ready for the best plant-based filling for your quesadillas.</p>
</h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Oyster mushrooms</li>
    <li>Smoked paprika</li>
    <li>Soy sauce</li>
    <li>Lemon juice</li>
    <li>White wine</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>First, slice your mushrooms and chop your garlic. I usually decide how much garlic I'm using while I prepare it. It's really up to you.</li>
    <li>Drizzle some olive oil (I beg you, don't use butter) in a pan over medium heat and add the garlic.</li>
    <li>Let it warm for a bit, just until it becomes lightly golden, and then add the paprika. A lot. Let the oil become red. I highly recommend you to add the spices to the oil, not the food.</li>
    <li>Now, the mushrooms. Stir it up for a bit so it mixes with the oil, the garlic and the spices, and then turn up the heat and wait for them to release all the water before anything else.</li>
    <li>For the sauce, first add the wine. Make yourself a favour and buy a good one for this one. You'll only need a little bit for the cooking part and you can have it while eating the mushrooms later.</li>
    <li>When the wine it's gone: soy sauce. Let it cook, don't use too much. Use as much as you like but don't let it flood, the mushrooms should be able to soak the sauce.</li>
    <li>Lemon juice time! Be careful with the seeds, one lemon should be enough for mushrooms for two, but again, unless it doesn't flood the food and the mushrooms are able to soak it up, it's up to your taste. Don't be afraid to try little by little until you get the flavour you like.</li>
</ol>

<p>By the time every liquid disappeared, the mushrooms should be ready! You can let it brown for a bit if it's not crispy enough but it should be a dense, meaty-like mass that smells like heaven by now. I usually do them for dinner, put them on wheat tortillas or toasted white bread and get drunk.</p>

<p><strong>Highly recommended.</strong></p>
