    <p>What's the most important meal of the day? Pan con manteca, jé.</p>
    <p>My favourite moment of the day is breakfast and I often go to sleep thinking about these eggs on buttered toasts.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Eggs (as many as you want, I usually do 1 per toast if I'm super hungry but one medium-large egg should be enough for 2 toasts)</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Oatmilk (or any milk of preference, this has more to do with consistence than flavour, but keep in mind that oatmilk is also sweet so it's on theme!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, heat your pan. Drizzle some olive oil (please, please use olive oil) and let it heat up over medium heat for a bit.</li>
        <li>When it's warm, add a little spoon of honey. Measure with your heart. Once it's melted with the oil, swirl the pan a bit so it covers the surface completely.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and a drizzle of oatmilk (not too much, just a tiny little bit it's enough to give it a creamy texture).</li>
        <li>Stir constantly until it's done. If you didn't use too much milk, you'll know when the egg is cooked. It shouldn't be runny, just soft.</li>
    </ol>
<p>I like to have my breakfast prepared before so I can immediately take the egg out of the pan so it doesn't cook more. I usually put it on buttered toast with a thin layer of cottage cheese. Then I put some cucumber slices on top, and I sprinkle salt flakes on it. The contrast is amazing.</p>
<p>This should give you enough energy for whatever you do in the mornings, and it you don't need it, well, at least it'll make you happy.</p>
