<p>The contrast between sweet and savory and little to no preparation.</p>
<p>Plus, I love it when the oven does it for you.</p>
</h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Phyllo dough</li>
<li>One apple</li>
<li>A fairly regular-sized wedge of brie cheese</li>
<li>One egg</li>
<li>200ml of heavy cream</li>
<li>Nuts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Prepare your phyllo dough while you preheat the oven. The usual package that you find in the supermarket (use one of whatever of them) comes in big paper thin slices. This is the most boring part of it, but it's basically the only “cooking” you'll do: fold each slice like an accordion.</p>
<p>This is tedious, but trust me, if I can do it coming back from the function you can make it for your family. You'll need a rectangular recipient for the oven, so try to fit the length of the slices to it. Cut some to fill the gaps or if it doesn't fit. As long as the accordion “holes” are facing up waiting for the delicious filling.</p></li>
<li>Cut the apple in half, then slice. Slice the brie and the chicken too. A cooked chicken breast should be enough, but I'll never know, cause I use Lidl vegetarian chicken that's perfectly sliced already. It's better if you brown it in olive oil for a bit before.</li>
<li>Fill the accordion just randomly.</li>
<li>Now, whip the egg, mix it with the heavy cream and pour it on top. Let the dough soak it, chop some nuts and sprinkle on top.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should turn out crispy but heavy and soft on the inside. It looks like a lot than I made it to be at the beginning but you'll become obsessed with it and do it so many times that you'll end up doing it super quickly.</p>
